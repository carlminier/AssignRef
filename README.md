### Feature #1 - Files Backend
⁘ I used my expertise in back-end development, leveraging technologies such as C#, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, and .NET Core. I Constructed RESTful API endpoints and routing requests to multiple data points using .NET Core, ensuring efficient record retrieval, seamless integration, and robust data handling. I designed tables and stored procedures using SQL/T-SQL, implementing joins, clauses, and JSON objects to optimize database operations for record retrieval. I completed the code and tested the controllers using the Postman client.

### Feature #2 - Videos Component

⁘ I led the development of the dynamic video component using React.js, transforming the way videos are played and selected across diverse categories. Users now enjoy a seamless experience, thanks to the efficient filtering techniques and component-based architecture I implemented. By ensuring a smooth and intuitive user interface, I provided easy access to desired videos.
