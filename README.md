### AssignRef is an innovative platform with everything you need in sports league management software, simplifying the process of connecting sporting events, referees, and users. 

⁘ I led the development of the dynamic video component using React, transforming the way videos are played and selected across diverse categories. Users now enjoy a seamless experience, thanks to the efficient filtering techniques and component-based architecture I implemented. By ensuring a smooth and intuitive user interface, I provided easy access to desired videos.

⁘ I used my expertise in both front-end and back-end development, leveraging technologies such as C#, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, and .NET Core. Implemented RESTful APIs and efficiently routed requests to multiple data points, resulting in optimal record retrieval, seamless integration, and robust data handling within the MVC framework. I utilized tables and SQL stored procedures to optimize database operations, enhancing query execution, and performance, and facilitated logical organization and record retrieval.
